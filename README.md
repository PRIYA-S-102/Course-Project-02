### Project Title :
Chatbot


### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
The college website contains a lot of information in text format. It’s really hard to find the answers to the appropriate queries. Getting details about the appropriate queries in the website is a Time Consuming and it is very stressful to collect a particular information like Fees Structure, Hostel Facility, Transport Facility, Scholarship Details, courses, etc., 

### Project Description :
Nowadays, many people are using smartphones with many new applications i.e., technology is growing day by day. Today Artificial Intelligence is playing a major role in a variety of fields ranging from industries in product manufacturing to customer care in public relations. As there are many online Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems or chatbots which are in existence that help people solve their problems. So, we are going to implement a virtual assistant based on AI that can solve any college-related query. This will work as a College Oriented Intelligence machine. This virtual machine will respond to the queries of students on college-related issues. A chatbot has information stored in its database to identify the sentences and make a decision itself as a response to answer a given question. The college inquiry chatbot will be built using an algorithm that analyses queries and understands users’ messages.
